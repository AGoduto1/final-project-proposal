    <h1>Welcome to Lewis University's Customer Service Survey</h1>
    <h2>Created by Angelo Goduto</h2>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>The plan for this project is to create a HTML website and people will have the ability to describe their
        service at Lewis University. After they describe there answer from multiple questions that I will ask,
        they will have the ability to send their responses to my email at angeloagoduto@lewisu.edu. 
    </h3>

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <h3>I plan to use HTML for this project</h3>

    <h2>Last Proposal Update</h2>
    <h3>This proposal was last update during sprint 5 on November 5th, 2021</h3>

    <h2>Priority</h2>
    <h3>My first goal is to create a interative website where people will have the opportunity to answer the questions
        within the website. I believe this can be delivered.
    </h3>

    <h2>Future Feature List</h2>
    <h3>I plan to be able to take the information that is provided and have the ability to automatically send the information
        to my email. This maybe a little more difficult, but I still think this is possible.
    </h3>

    <h2>Basic Technical Features</h2>
    <h3>The features that I will have provided will be creating a website that looks clean and has all of the questions that
        are easy to read for the person that will be interacting with the website. I will also be including some photos 
        in the website that I create.
    </h3>

    <h2>Advance Technical Features</h2>
    <h3>The way I will make my project more advanced is by creating the ability for the participant to interact with the website.
        I will also give an opportunity for the participant to send me their survey after it has been completed.
    </h3>
