    <title>Final Project Proposal</title>

<body>
    <center><h1>Welcome to Lewis University's Customer Service Survey</h1></center>
    <center><h2>Created by Angelo Goduto</h2></center>

    <center><h2>Overview</h2></center>
    <center><h4>The plan for this project is to create an HTML website and people will have the ability to describe their 
        service at Lewis University. After they describe their answer to multiple questions that I will ask, they will have 
        the ability to send their responses to my email at angeloagoduto@lewisu.edu.

    <center><h2>Technology</h2></center>
    <center><h4>I plan to use HTML for this project</h4></center>

    <center><h2>Last Proposal Update</h2></center>
    <center><h4>This proposal was last updated during sprint 6 on December 5th, 2021</h4></center>

    <center><h2>Priority</h2></center>
    <center><h4>My first goal is to create an interactive website where people will have the opportunity to answer the 
        questions within the website. I believe this can be delivered.
    </h4></center>

    <center><h2>Future Feature List</h2></center>
    <center><h4>I plan to be able to take the information that is provided and have the ability to automatically send 
        the information to my email. This may be a little more difficult, but I still think this is possible.
    </h4></center>

    <center><h2>Basic Technical Features</h2></center>
    <center><h4>The features that I will have provided will be creating a website that looks clean and has all of the 
        questions that are easy to read for the person that will be interacting with the website. I will also be 
        including some photos on the website that I create.
    </h4></center>

    <center><h2>Advance Technical Features</h2></center>
    <center><h4>The way I will make my project more advanced is by creating the ability for the participant to 
        interact with the website. I will also give an opportunity for the participant to send me their survey after 
        it has been completed.
